# AmFoss Task Status

## Introduction

I am **Ranga Laxmi Jahnavi**, a first-year BTech student in Computer Science Engineering at **Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri campus**. I enjoy problem-solving and have basic coding experience, mainly in Python. I am also passionate about editing. I always strive to improve myself and put in my best effort in every task I take on.

## Why should we choose you?

I am motivated, disciplined, and eager to learn. During the Praveshan tasks, I stayed consistent and gave my maximum effort in completing the ones I could, but couldn't do well in between due to a few other unavoidable blockers. I enjoy challenging myself and learning new things along the way. I’m confident that my hard work and determination will make me a valuable member of AmFoss.

## How do you intend to contribute back to the club?

I plan to actively participate in all the club’s initiatives and share any knowledge I gain to help others grow. I am ready to dedicate my time and energy to the club and will contribute to projects that align with the goals of AmFoss. I am also keen on representing the club in competitions and showcasing our work.

## What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?

I am interested in programming, web development, and cybersecurity. My primary goal is to strengthen my coding skills and learn how to build secure systems. I’m curious about open-source contributions and want to learn how to collaborate on real-world projects. Joining AmFoss would be a great opportunity to develop these skills and work on meaningful ideas with like-minded peers.

## What are your thoughts and feedback on the Praveshan Selection Process?

The tasks were engaging and helped me discover new areas of interest. While some were tough, they were all opportunities to learn something new. I appreciate the support from mentors, which made the process more manageable. Although I couldn’t finish all the tasks, I’m grateful for the knowledge and experience I gained along the way.
